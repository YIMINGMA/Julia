# Think-Julia-How-to-Think-Like-A-Computer-Scientist

This repository contains solutions to exercises from [Think Julia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html).

Here, I'd like to present my gratitude towards the author, Ben Lauwens, for making this book entirely open-source.

## Comments

1. Due to errors with ```using ThinkJulia``` (maybe Ben needs to update this module), I cannot do exercises in Chapter 4 Case Study: Interface Design.
